This directory contains the code for Sharna Virtual Machine (SVM).
SVM is free software. See the files whose names start with COPYING for copying permission.

Building the project from source can be done through the traditional CMake way, although I am looking forward to a configure script.
The `tests/` directory contains many examples of how SVM Assembler works, with an example `test.c` that explains how to use the VM.

A documentation is underway; if anyone wants to contribute one, feel free to fork and raise a PR.
The `lib/std` directory contains the code for Sharna Standard Library (SSL/STD); feel free to add any routines which could reduce repetitive tasks.

A C Compiler for SVM is idealized, although I am not sure whether I would code it in assembly or as a separate project that just generates bytecode.
